								<p>Hi, I'm Amit Sami, 29 years of age living in Brisbane, Australia. I am married and have one son. My RMIT student number is S3790837. I currently work fulltime and am studying part time. I am a proud member of The C-Sharps. My mother and father are both Fijian-Indian. I was born in New Zealand and grew up in Sydney. Some of my hobbies are fishing, playing sports and computer games. I have an interest in programming in IT and how applications work. I also have a great interest in all the technology that is available in the health industry and wish to have some input in technology to do with health in the future. I do not have any IT experience.</p><br>

<h2>Test Results:</h2>
<h3>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Test Result</h3>
 <p7>
Peronality type - Protagonist
<br>
89% Extraverted
<br>
67% intuitive
<br>
58% feeling
<br>
54% judging
<br>
100% assertive
<br>
<br>
The test results seem to reflect my personality accurately. I do usually like to talk and get to know people when I work with them so I 
can understand their background. This helps me in understanding why people do things in certain ways. When working in a group or forming 
a team I need to consider that not everyone likes to talk. It could make them feel uncomfortable. One of the main reasons I do it though 
is to break the ice and try and make people feel comfortable. I also need to make sure that people do not feel that I do not do any work 
and just talk so I will need to make sure I put my fair share or more of input into the work.

<h3>What's Your Learning Style Result</h3>
 <p8>
Auditory: 35%
<br>
Visual: 25%
<br>
Tactile: 40%
<br>
<br>
The results of this test show that I am a hands-on learner. This is true as I feel like I don?t learn as much from just reading compared 
to doing the task. I can have somebody show me how to do it and it will not really make too much sense until I do the task. If working in 
a team this would be difficult if everyone else in the team is reading the task to try and plan on what do to as I would prefer to do 
some of the task to get a better understanding on what needs to be done. I need to be mindful of this as it may seem I am not interested 
in the task or it may seem that I think I am ahead of everyone else while doing the task.

<h3>Creativity Test Result</h3>
 <p9>
In my creativity test I got 75.21. The average score is 63.36. This means I am above average when it comes to creativity, but I am not 
the most creative person. This test result shows that I tend to follow things the way they should be done. I only think of a change if it 
is required. In a group I might not have as much input as others might. At the same time, I feel that my input might not be as creative, 
but it might be more of a safer and logical answer to issues. When working in a team I should consider that everyone is different, and we 
all bring different qualities to the group. That is what makes the team.
